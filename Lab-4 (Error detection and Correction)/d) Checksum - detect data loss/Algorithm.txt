1. The client program will prompt the user to enter the message to be sent.
2. The client calculates the checksum of the message using a checksum algorithm 
(such as CRC32).
3. The client sends the message along with the checksum to the server.
4. The server receives the message and extracts the checksum from the header.
5. The server calculates the checksum of the received message.
6. The server compares the received checksum with the calculated checksum.
7. If the checksums match, the server accepts the message and processes it.
8. If the checksums do not match, the server requests retransmission of the message.
9. Steps 4-8 are repeated until a valid message with a matching checksum is received
