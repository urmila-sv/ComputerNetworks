1. Start by defining the code parameters for the Hamming code, including the code 
length and the minimum Hamming distance required.
2. Read the binary string input from the user.
3. Check if the length of the binary string matches the defined code length. If not, 
return false.
4. Initialize a variable to count the number of differing bits.
5. Iterate through each bit in the binary string and compare it with the corresponding 
bit in the predefined Hamming code.
6. If the bits are different, increment the differing bits count.
7. If the differing bits count exceeds the minimum Hamming distance, return false.
8. If the loop completes without exceeding the minimum Hamming distance, return 
true to indicate that the string meets the requirement.
