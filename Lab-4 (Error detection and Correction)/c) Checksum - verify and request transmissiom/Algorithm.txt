1. The client and server establish a connection.
2. The client prepares the data to be sent in packets of a fixed size.
3. For each packet, the client calculates the checksum using a suitable checksum 
algorithm (e.g., CRC, Adler-32, etc.).
4. The client includes the calculated checksum in the packet along with the data.
5. The client sends the packet to the server.
6. The server receives the packet.
7. The server calculates the checksum of the received data using the same 
algorithm used by the client.
8. The server compares the calculated checksum with the checksum included in the 
packet.
9. If the checksums match, the server accepts the packet and processes the data.
10. If the checksums do not match, the server requests retransmission of the 
packet.
11. The client receives the retransmission request from the server and resends the 
packet.
12. Steps 6-11 are repeated until the server receives a packet with a correct 
checksum.
13. Once all packets have been successfully received and processed by the server, 
the client and server can terminate the connection.
